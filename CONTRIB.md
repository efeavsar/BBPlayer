# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them:

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign email to us explaining your 
	interest on github. (support@lonict.co.uk)
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to send an email explaining your partnership/collobration on github. 
	(support@lonict.co.uk)
  * Any of emails above should be including wording "github" in subject. So we can response
	your request quickly.
